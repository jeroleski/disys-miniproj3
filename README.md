### Distributed Systems 2021 -- Miniproject 3
Hand-in Date: 1 December 2021 (at 23:59)

# What to submit on learnit:
- a **single** zip-compressed file containing: a folder src containing
the source code. You are only allowed to submit source code files in
this folder.

- A file report.pdf containing a report (in PDF) with your answers;
the file can be **at most** 5 A4 pages (it can be less), font cannot
be smaller than 9pt. The report has to contain 4 sections (see below
for a detailed specification of the report format). The report cannot
contain source code (except possibly for illustrative code snippets).

- (Optional) a text file log.txt containing log(s).



## A Distributed Auction System
You must implement a **distributed auction system** using replication:
a distributed component which handles auctions, and provides
operations for bidding and querying the state of an auction. The
component must faithfully implement the semantics of the system
described below, and must at least be resilient to one (1) crash
failure.

# API
Your system must be implemented as some number of nodes, possibly
running on distinct hosts. Clients direct API requests to any node
they happen to know (it is up to you to decide how many nodes can be
known). Nodes must respond to the following API:

Method: bid
Inputs: amount (an int)
Outputs: ack
Comment: given a bid, returns an outcome among {fail, success or exception}

Method: result
Inputs: void amount (an int)
Ouputs: outcome
Comment: if over, it returns the result, else highest bid. 

# Semantics
Your component must have the following behaviour, for any reasonable
sequentialisation/interleaving of requests to it:
- The first call to "bid" registers the bidder.

- Bidders can bid several times, but a bid must be higher than the
  previous one(s).

- after a specified timeframe, the highest bidder ends up as the
  winner of the auction.

- bidders can query the system in order to know the state of the
  auction.

# Faults
- Assume a network that has reliable, ordered message transport, where
  transmissions to non-failed nodes complete within a known
  time-limit.

- Your component must be resilient to the failure-stop failure of one
   (1) node.

- You may assume that crashes only happen “one at a time”; e.g.,
  between a particular client request and the system’s subsequent
  response, you may assume that at most one crash occurs. However, a
  second crash may still happen during subsequent requests. For
  example, the node receiving a request might crash. On the next
  request, another node in the system might crash.

# Report
Write a report of at most 5 pages containing the following structure
(exactly create four sections as below):

- Introduction. A short introduction to what you have done.

- Protocol. A description of your protocol, including any protocols
  used internally between nodes of the system.

- Correctness 1. An argument that your protocol is correct
  in the absence of failures.

- Correctness 2. An argument that your protocol is correct in the
  presence of failures.

# Implementation
- Implement your system in GoLang. We strongly recommend that you
  reuse the the frameworks and libraries used in the previous
  mandatory activites.

- You may submit a log (as a separate file) documenting a correct
  system run under failures. Your log can be a collection of relevant
  print statements, that demonstrates the control flow trough the
  system. It must be clear from the log where crashes occur.
